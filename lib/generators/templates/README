Some setup you must do in order to make things working

  1. Change your devise model name in initializer if you plan to use an existing
     model, or if you plan to generate a model with a name which is not User

  2. Change your desired domain for authentication (default gmail.com)

  3. Run rails g google_authentication MODEL for creating a default model
